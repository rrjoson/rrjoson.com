I'm a classical pianist turned software engineer. I was born in 1994 and grew up in the Philippines. After going to University of Santo Tomas Conservatory of Music studying classical piano performance, I started self learning web development and landed my first internship after 5 months.

I've written code for Uwai, White Widget, and also made a few open source contributions.

I now work full-time as a software engineer at Laguro.

On my free time, I create content all about web development on various platforms including: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rrjoson)
